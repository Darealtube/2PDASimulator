      <h3>Hello! Welcome to our guide on how to use our simulator.</h3>

      <p>
        Before we begin, we would like to mention that this simulator was done
        in a span of 3 days, so the design is not next-level, but the
        functionality is working properly. This 2-PDA Guide will help you know
        what to input in the transition tables, in the textfields, and also in
        simulation. Without further ado, here is the guide for the 2-PDA
        Simulator.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2-PDA simulator has two parts. It has the input part in which you
        define the "definition" of the 2-PDA machine:
      </p>

      <image
        src="./guideAssets/1.png"
        height="400px"
        width="100%"
        alt="guide"
      />

      <p>
        And the bottom part which is the simulation part, in which the machine
        will execute according to the definition and the input string:
      </p>

      <image
        src="./guideAssets/2.png"
        height="400px"
        width="100%"
        alt="guide"
      />

      <p>
        The input part of the simulator is the only interactable part of the
        page initially. That is because you cannot possibly simulate "nothing".
        The textfields to the right of the transition table already gives you a
        clue as to what you'll put there. However, there are some key things to
        remember.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          In the input string textfield, you can choose to not input anything.
          This would function as an empty input.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the possible inputs textfield, you absolutely must type your
          possible inputs in between commas, and if you have inputs for example
          "a", and you have another input which is "aa", you must include both
          "a" and "aa" in the list.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the possible stack symbols textfield, the initial symbols of the
          stacks are Z0 and Z1. Which means that these are already included in
          the list (no need to list them). If you have stack symbols for example
          "a", and you have another input which is "aa", you must include both
          "a" and "aa" in the list.
        </li>
        <li>Inputs are case-sensitive.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That is all there is to take note about the right side part of the input
        part. Now, we will focus on the transition table.
      </p>

      <image
        src="./guideAssets/3.png"
        height="400px"
        width="100%"
        alt="guide"
      />

      <p>
        This is the transition table. Each row in the transition table has 5
        rows. You can add more rows by clicking the tiny + button below the rows
        of the table. Here are the requirements for each textfield of each row:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Current State: a single input string containing the name of the state
        </li>
        <li>
          Next State: a single input string containing the name of the state it
          goes to after a certain input
        </li>
        <li>
          Input: the input that could be read by the state to perform
          transitions
        </li>
        <li>
          Stack 1 OP(eration): the operation to be performed to stack 1 on
          transition (symbol to replace);(symbol to replace with)
        </li>
        <li>
          Stack 2 OP(eration): the operation to be performed to stack 2 on
          transition (symbol to replace);(symbol to replace with)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Now that we know what to input in those textfields, there are some
        crucial things to note:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Input can be left blank. (empty input)</li>
        <li>
          There are four kinds of stack operation that you can input. These are:
          <ul>
            <li>
              (blank);(blank) or simply ; - This means do nothing (replace empty
              with empty)
            </li>
            <li>
              (blank);(symbol) - This means add to the stack (replace empty with
              symbol)
            </li>
            <li>
              (symbol);(blank) - This means remove from the stack (replace
              symbol with empty)
            </li>
            <li>(symbol);(symbol) - The usual</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          When doing stack operations, symbols like "aa" for example will not
          add two "a" into the stack (if that is what you are planning to do).
          Use (blank);a instead to add "a". It's actually more simplified that
          way and will make your life easier.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>This is an example of a good and valid transition table:</p>

      <image
        src="./guideAssets/4.png"
        height="400px"
        width="100%"
        alt="guide"
      />

      <p>
        These notes are important to keep in mind in order for your machine to
        be simulated properly. Don't worry, if there is something wrong in your
        input, when you click submit it will tell you that there is an error and
        will not let you simulate the machine.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now let us move on to the simulation part. The simulation starts at the
        initial state with no input string being read. When an input string is
        being read, the input character on the input string stack will be
        highlighted. Then the verdict will be displayed which would be if it's
        accepted or rejected, the action part will display what operation
        happened, and the state when the input is read will also be displayed.
        This part is pretty simple as there are only four controls which have a
        very straightforward functionality:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Previous Input - Goes back to the previous input in the simulation
        </li>
        <li>Next Input - Proceeds to the next input in the simulation</li>
        <li>Back to Start - Resets the simulation</li>
        <li>
          Edit PDA Input - Resets the simulation and enables the input part so
          you'd be able to change your definition (disables simulation)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The simulator prioritizes transitions that have inputs over blank
        inputs. If two transitions have the same input, it will choose the next
        state based on which transition's stack operations appeals to the top of
        the stack of both stacks. If you find that you're clicking next input
        but it's not doing anything, it's either you've reached the end of the
        machine simulation or the current state cannot go to another state using
        the next input string, which means that the input string is rejected.
      </p>

      <p>
        And that is it for the guide! If you have any other concerns or there is
        a bug within the simulator, please contact us:
